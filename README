ZRECore provides a Mobile and E-Commerce boiler-plate application, based on the Zend Framework.

This code is provided to you under the terms of the GNU General Public License V3 or higher. It can be found at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

Remember to install the following via PEAR (Used by the ZRECore application):
 * Zend Framework - See http://code.google.com/p/zend/

Requires PHP 5.3 or higher, SQLight3 or higher, the Zend Framework, and the Standard PHP Library (SPL)


The administrative URL by default is /admin/.

Please note: Because this project is still being developed, it isn't ready for production. I've yet to re-add ACLs, Authentication, and a couple of other things I found particularly useful from the ZRECommerce project.


I was inspired by some of the nicer features found in Wordpress, Joomla, and a few things I did right during the ZRECommerce project. If interested in developing code, contact me via my blog at www.alexventure.com

Sample observer - Hooks into our Observer/Subject environment and echos "Hello World!" when the "Auth" subject's "setIsAuthenticated()" method is called. This sample is designed to help you create your own custom observer classes.
